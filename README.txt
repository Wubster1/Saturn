Hi all! 
I'm Wubbe and this is my first post here. I like to create things, but it gets stuck when I need to program (an Arduino). My latest creation is a Space-Saturn. I've copied some code from internet (https://youtu.be/_6LXKuo28M0 Thanks for that!) And it works (see my instagram link)
But....
I want to change some things:
-at first I want to have 1 led go round very slowly, but smooth. So when the led goes round it needs to fade in / and out.
-then I want the led going faster and faster. With the speed I want the tale to grow.
-until the max speed is arrived, then I want fireworks. stoboscope blinking the whole ring, like it's exploding.

Hopefully some programmers here can help me :-)
